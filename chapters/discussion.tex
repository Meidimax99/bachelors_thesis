% Possible performance improvements:
% In-Line Interrupt Handling for Software-Managed TLBs -> reducing size
% of miss handler -> inlining it into reorder buffer

\section{Restrictions of the current design}
A segmented design has some restrictions compared to contemporary virtual memory
systems. In the following, important requirements to typical virtual memory
systems are presented and how the presented design can hold up.
\todo{How it fullfills these requirements now, how it may or may not fullfill currently
    unsupported requirements.}
