The **guide** is typeset with the PSIThesis template, and it contains a lot
of **concrete recommendations (Chapter 2)** that may help you write
a compelling scientific thesis. A particular focus is on the topic of
**designing useful figures and tables (Appendix B)**.

Read Chapters 1 and 2 in the guide for instructions on using the template.
All source files that are needed to build the guide are contained in this
repository. You can refer to the source files to see how the template is used
in a real-world document.

Note that the guide contains some figures that have been reproduced from
the literature with permission of the publishers and the authors. As we do not
have permission to redistribute these figures, they are not contained in
this repository.

The **template** consists of a document class (PSIThesis.cls) and
additional TeX files. It is based on the MastersDoctoralThesis template
(https://www.latextemplates.com/template/masters-doctoral-thesis).


### Who Made This and Why?

The template and the guide have been created by members of the **Chair
of Privacy and Security in Information Systems** (“PSI”) at the **University
of Bamberg in Germany** (https://www.uni-bamberg.de/psi/). We had
collected recommendations on thesis writing for many years and wanted
to help our students submit a high-quality Bachelor's or Master's thesis.
The template could also be used for for seminar reports and PhD dissertations.
As the material is of general interest, we have released everything publicly
under an open license.

We encourage our students to use the template without any changes. The
PSIThesis template and the guide reflect, at least to some degree, the personal
taste of members of the chair. If you *do* have a different opinion on a particular
 aspect of the template or the guide, we will be happy to hear you out.

You can reach us via Twitter [(@herdom)](https://twitter.com/herdom) or [email](mailto:dh.psi@uni-bamberg.de).

### Changes and Contributions

The template and the guide are available under an open license (CC BY SA 4.0). 
If you want to use the template for a thesis submitted at a different 
department or organization, feel free to make changes at your discretion.
Redistribution of the guide and the template is subject to the license (see
details explained in LICENSE.md and the Guide).

If you wish to contribute to the template or the guide, you may create an
Issue or a Pull Request in the GitHub repository.
